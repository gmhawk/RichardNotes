1. You started coding immediately. I would recommend you write down pseudo-code or "plan of attack" before starting to write any code.

2. Follow-up on #1, Testing. Once you have a "plan of attack", run through test cases before coding.

3. When you kept talking about 'i' and 'j', you were referring to the column and row of the matrix. It's best to try to use English understandable terms in that case to help interviewer understand better.

4. You can leave certain part of your plan unoptimized, but make note so that you go back to optimize it once you have a working solution.
